Conclusion</span></h2>
<p class="auto-style2" style="font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; float: none;">
Interest in organic agriculture methods is growing, especially in areas where 
the present farming system has degraded resources essential to agricultural 
production (especially land). Non-production factors, such as the farmer's 
health, are also mentioned as a reason for shifting to organic management. 
Consumers also have an interest in organic agriculture. Consumer awareness of 
the environmental costs of agriculture (such as the deteriorating quality of 
drinking water and soil, and the impact of agriculture on landscape and 
wildlife) is increasing. The awareness of environmental quality and health is 
often promoted by environmental groups, especially in developed countries. The 
resulting demand for organic products creates the opportunity to sell organic 
products at premium prices, enabling organic farmers to continue, and often 
expand</p>
<p class="auto-style3" style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">
In developing countries, two schools of interest in organic agriculture 
practices can be detected. First, some farmers switch to organic production 
without the incentive of price premiums, finding other economic and 
environmental reasons sufficient for management changes. In this case, improved 
conditions on the farm are the main focus of concern, especially increased and 
more sustained production as compared with what has been possible previously. 
Less dependence on outside inputs is also noted. As well as economic and 
environmental impacts, the introduction of organic principles in agricultural 
management brings social benefits as farmers adopt a logic close to their 
traditions and values.</p>
<p class="auto-style4" style="font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">
More frequently, farmers switch to organic agriculture in order to secure market 
premiums. In this second case, the increased income can help in improving the 
local food security situation, but variations in price over time should be 
anticipated. At present the size of the organic market is small (typically less 
than one percent in most countries), and therefore a small change in organic 
production will mean a large percentage change in quantity available, 
influencing price. Increased organic production in the future may have a 
depressing influence on prices; however, increased consumption may offset any 
downward pressure on prices.</p>
<p class="auto-style3" style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">
National governments can play a role in encouraging the adoption of organic 
agriculture in developing countries.<b><span>&nbsp;</span></b>Research and 
development, education and extension into organic agriculture methods, 
legalization of the word "organic" and implementation of a certification scheme, 
and refraining from manipulating input and output prices (such that organic 
agriculture becomes less attractive to farmers) as well as the all important 
issue of land-tenure, all merit policy consideration.</p>
